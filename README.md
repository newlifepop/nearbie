Nearbie is a location-based social app. Users can post messages (photos, videos) and select the location where the post can be seen by people nearby.

Another core functionality of the app is called "Local Community", where people sharing the same interests can create a group and join any group they want.

Nearbie is written in JavaScript, using Facebook's react native framework. The backend of the app is Google's Firebase.
